    <h2>Bayern Munich</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Fußball-Club Bayern München e.V., commonly known as FC Bayern München, FCB, Bayern Munich, or FC Bayern, is a German
            sports club based in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. It is best known for its professional football team, which plays in the Bundesliga,
            the top tier of the German football league system, and is the most successful club in German football history,
            having won a record 26 national titles and 18 national cups.<br><br>
            FC Bayern was founded in 1900 by 11 football players, led by Franz John. Although Bayern won its first national championship in 1932,
            the club was not selected for the Bundesliga at its inception in 1963. The club had its period of greatest success in the middle of the 1970s when, under the captaincy of Franz Beckenbauer,
            it won the European Cup three times in a row (1974–1976). Overall, Bayern has reached ten European Cup/UEFA Champions League finals, most recently winning their fifth title in 2013 as part of a continental treble.
            Bayern has also won one UEFA Cup, one European Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one FIFA Club World Cup and two Intercontinental Cups, making it one of the most successful European clubs internationally. Since the formation of the Bundesliga,
            Bayern has been the dominant club in German football with 26 titles and has won 8 of the last 12 titles. They have traditional local rivalries with 1860 Munich and 1. FC Nürnberg, as well as with Borussia Dortmund since the mid-1990s.
            <br><br>Since the beginning of the 2005–06 season, Bayern has played its home games at the Allianz Arena. Previously the team had played at Munich's Olympiastadion for 33 years. The team colours are red and white,
            and the team crest shows the white and blue flag of Bavaria. In terms of revenue, Bayern Munich is the biggest sports club in Germany and the third biggest football club in the world, generating €487.5 million for the 2013–14 season.
            Bayern has over 270,000 members. There are more than 4,000 officially-registered fan clubs with over 314,000 members.
            The club has other departments for chess, handball, basketball, gymnastics, bowling, table tennis and senior football with more than 1,100 active members.
            <br><br>FC Bayern is ranked second in the current UEFA club coefficient rankings and fourth in IFFHS's latest IFFHS Club World Ranking.
